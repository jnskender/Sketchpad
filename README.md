---Pre Project---  
This assignment is to build a webpage that dynamically builds a user defined  
set of divs as a grid system that can be used as a primitive sketchpad    
as the user hovers in and out of each div.    
  
This projects goals is to help me test my knowledge of basic Javascript    
and jQuery while also continuing to build skills in HTML and CSS.    
  
  
--Post Project--  
After completing this project I believe I have a firm grasp on using the jQuery library    
to manipulate the dom. I further cemented my knowledge of HTML and CSS to style the page  
in a meaningful layout as well. The biggest take away from this project for me was learning   
how different algorithms for creating grids of massive size could be made more efficient by    
taking jQuery selectors outside of any loops. When I was selecting inside my loops I could only  
create grids around 60 * 60 before the script basically crashed. Taking selectors outside of the   
loop and only appending one I could efficiently create grids around 200 * 200 without crashing.   

If I had more time on this projects I could think of many ways to make it more functional such as   
- RGB color value picker for the brush  
- Brush density by selecting multiple divs at once
- An eraser function
- etc.
